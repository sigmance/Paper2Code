The complexity of biomedical topics require increasingly deep and specific subject matter expertise, while leaps in insight may still arise from broad knowledge bridging across disciplines. With the rapid rise in scientific publications and the availability of numerous technologies for specialized high-throughput assays, mastery of both discipline-specific depth and trans-disciplinary insight can be challenging. Despite these challenges, many modern breakthroughs have emerged from trans-disciplinary endeavours. Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on CRISPR [1] , which combined techniques and strategies ranging from microbiology to genetics to molecular biology.

Given a research goal specified in natural language, the system can search and reason over relevant literature to summarize and synthesize prior work and build on it to propose novel, original research hypotheses and experimental protocols for downstream validations (Figure 1a ). The co-scientist provides grounding for its recommendations by citing relevant literature and explaining the reasoning behind its proposals. This work does not aim to completely automate the scientific process with AI. Instead, the co-scientist is purpose-built for a \"scientist-in-the-loop\" collaborative paradigm, to help domain experts augment their hypothesis generation process and guide the exploration that follows.

We validate the co-scientist's capability in three impactful areas of biomedicine with varied complexity: (1) drug repurposing, (2) novel treatment targets discovery, and (3) new mechanistic explanations for antimicrobial resistance (Figure 1b ). Drug development is an increasingly time-consuming and expensive process [16] in which new therapeutics require restarting many aspects of the discovery and development process for each indication or disease (roughly 70% of drug approvals are for new drugs). In contrast, drug repurposing--identifying novel therapeutic indications for drugs beyond their original intended use--has emerged as a compelling strategy to address these challenges [17] . Successful examples of repurposing include Humira (adalimumab) and Keytruda (pembrolizumab), both of which have become among the most successful drugs in history. [17] . The process typically involves analyzing molecular signatures, signaling pathways, drug interactions, clinical trial results, adverse event reports, and other literature-based information [18] , along with off-label use data and, in some cases, patient experiences. However, drug repurposing is limited by several factors: (1) the need for extensive expertise across biomedical, molecular biology, and biochemical systems, (2) the inherent complexity of mammalian biological systems, and (3) the time-intensive nature of traditional computational biology analyses required. We leverage the co-scientist to generate predictions for large-scale drug repurposing, validating the generated predictions using a combination of computational biology, expert clinician feedback, and in vitro wet-lab validation approaches. Notably, our system has proposed novel repurposing candidates for acute myeloid leukamia (AML) that inhibit tumor viability at clinically relevant concentrations in vitro across multiple AML cell lines.", "section": "Introduction", "sec_num": "1"}, {"text": "Unlike drug repurposing, which is a combinatorial search problem through a large but constrained set of |3 drugs and diseases, identifying novel treatment targets for diseases presents a more significant challenge, traditionally requiring extensive literature review, deep biological understanding, sophisticated hypothesis generation and complex experimental validation strategies. The uncertainty of identifying novel treatment targets is significantly greater than in drug repurposing, as it involves not only repurposing existing compounds but also uncovering entirely new components and mechanisms within biological systems. This target discovery process can be inefficient, potentially leading to suboptimal hypothesis selection and prioritization for in vitro and in vivo experimentation. Given the high costs and time associated with experimental validation, a more effective approach is needed. We probe the capabilities of the co-scientist to propose, rank, and provide experimental protocols for novel research hypotheses pertaining to target discovery. To demonstrate this capability, we focus on liver fibrosis, a prevalent and serious disease, showcasing the co-scientist's potential to discover novel treatment targets amenable to experimental validation.

The resulting format contextualizes proposed repurposing candidates within known mechanisms based on current literature and then extrapolates to a new disease state. An expert oncologist methodically evaluated and excluded hypotheses that were deemed clinically implausible or had limited potential for successful translation, as well as those falling outside the expertise of the assembled specialist evaluators.

For example, bisphosphonate agents like pamidronate, while associated with improved outcomes in observational studies of patients with bone metastases, were excluded after critical evaluation revealed their benefits stemmed primarily from reduction of skeletal-related events (such as pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and bone pain requiring radiation) rather than from disease modifying activity of the drug-candidate.", "section": "The AI co-scientist suggests plausible drug repurposing candidates as rated by experts", "sec_num": "4.5.1"}, {"text": "Six board-certified hematologists & oncologists from a single institution -including four domain-specific oncologists specializing in gastrointestinal (GI), breast, gynecologic (GYN) and genitourinary (GU) cancers and two general hematologist & oncologists, with an average of eight years of clinical experience -evaluated 78 unique drug repurposing hypotheses presented in the NIH Specific Aims Page format (for specific indication distribution and counts, see Appendix Section A.5.1).", "section": "The AI co-scientist suggests plausible drug repurposing candidates as rated by experts", "sec_num": "4.5.1"}, {"text": "The expert raters evaluated the generated Specific Aims based on a modified NIH grant proposal evaluation rubric, consisting of 15 axes focusing on (1) importance of research (significance and innovation) and ( 2) approach (rigor and feasibility).

While the points above provide a rationale, they don't guarantee that CXCR1/2 inhibition alone will be sufficient in all, or even most, cases of AML. The heterogeneity of AML, with its multitude of driver mutations and compensatory pathways, strongly suggests that combination therapies will ultimately be necessary for many patients. The strength of the proposal lies in its methodical approach. It doesn't claim that Reparixin is a magic bullet. It sets out to systematically investigate its potential, both alone and in combination, and to identify the specific patient subsets most likely to benefit. The extensive in vivo and patient stratification studies are key to addressing the \"sufficiency\" question empirically. The proposal is essentially a very detailed roadmap for determining when and how CXCR1/2 inhibition can be most effectively used in AML treatment, rather than an assertion of universal single-agent efficacy.

By binding to XPO1, Selinexor blocks the nuclear export of these molecules, leading to their accumulation in the nucleus and restoration of tumor suppressor function, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis induction.Repurposing Selinexor for COAD is rationally supported by its mechanism of action and the molecular characteristics of the disease. Overexpression of XPO1 is common in various cancers, including COAD [1, 2, 6] . Selinexor inhibits XPO1, preventing the nuclear export and restoring the function of key tumor suppressors (p53, RB, FOXO, APC) frequently dysregulated in COAD [2, 3, 4, 5] . Furthermore, Selinexor can suppress constitutively activated NF-\u03baB signaling, a driver of chronic inflammation and tumor progression in COAD, by blocking I\u03baB export and increasing its nuclear accumulation [7, 8] . These mechanisms align with key aspects of COAD pathogenesis and offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention. We hypothesize that Selinexor will effectively inhibit COAD cell growth and enhance apoptosis by restoring tumor suppressor function and modulating crucial signaling pathways. Selinexor has shown anti-tumor activity in solid tumors in a Phase I trial [3] , with observations of nuclear accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins [3, 6] . While not specific to COAD, these findings, coupled with evidence of Selinexor's efficacy in other cancers driven by XPO1 overexpression [3, 6] , suggest that a similar mechanism could be effective in COAD.

The AI co-scientist is a general purpose system broadly applicable across different areas of science and medicine.To better understand the capabilities and limitations of the system, we task it with the goal of suggesting protein sequences with specific properties. Determining the correct primary amino acid sequence with the desired properties is an essential part of protein engineering. While LLM-based systems can predict protein properties and suggest modifications [3] , they can sometimes generate incorrect sequences (i.e., hallucinations).To address this, we integrate AlphaFold [4] , a specialized AI system for predicting protein 3D structure, into our co-scientist. AlphaFold acts as a validation tool, evaluating the structural plausibility of sequences proposed by the co-scientist and provides feedback. This increases the reliability of the sequence design optimization process, which can be further validated with wet laboratory experiments. The approach to integrate tools highlights how specialized AI models can work in collaboration with more general AI systems like the AI co-scientist, facilitating the solution of complex challenges like protein design.As an illustrative example, we used AlphaFold to assess a co-scientist's proposed modification to the OCT4 (octamer-binding transcription factor 4) protein (Appendix Figure A.40), one of the four Yamanaka factors [5] , to increase binding affinity of its DNA binding domain. The co-scientist suggested adding a mechano-sensitive loop to the POU domain (a family of eukaryotic transcription factors) and a dynamic phosphorylation site outside of it. The co-scientist first verified the proposed sequence against the UniProt database via websearch. AlphaFold then predicted the 3D structure of the modified protein, suggesting that the modifications maintained structural stability. These predictions were used to refine the co-scientist's hypothesis, allowing it to improve its protein sequence design in subsequent iterations. We also independently validated the modification using ESM-2 [6] and RoseTTAFold [7] . ESM-2 predicted an increased log-likelihood ratio and a similar predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT), and RoseTTAFold predicted similar confidence score (GDT), compared to the original sequence. The insertion and modification did not seem to disrupt SOX2 and OCT4 interactions, indicated by the similar pLDDT scores between the original and modified OCT4 sequences. However, this example is for demonstration purposes only. Further in silico analysis (e.g., predicting binding affinity and off-target effects), and thorough laboratory validation are necessary to confirm that the proposed modifications actually improve the complex roles of OCT4 binding, while maintaining SOX2 interaction integrity, during pluripotency. Combining AlphaFold with the co-scientist framework offers a powerful approach for both improving existing proteins and designing entirely new ones. This integrated system allows researchers to iteratively optimize protein sequences for enhanced properties (e.g., stability, binding affinity, or catalytic activity) or putatively to create proteins with novel functions. It enables exploration of protein design while ensuring structural feasibility. Future work will focus on experimentally validating these capabilities and applying them to targeted protein design efforts as well as expansion to integration of other specialized AI tools with the co-scientist.", "section": "Critiques", "sec_num": null}], "ref_entries": {"FIGREF0": {"uris": null, "text": "provides an example of the feasibility improvement prompt. \u2022 Inspiration from existing hypotheses.
